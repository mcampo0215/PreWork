# Prework - *My Prework*

Submitted by: **Matthew Campoverde**

**MyPrework** is an app that changes the background color of the screen when a button is pressed.

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
- [ ] Instagram : instagram reels that are recommended based on your activity and liked or most interacted videos
- [ ] Tiktok : a for you page that recommends new videos based on activity and interaction as well.
- [ ] CalAI : a calorie tracking feature that gives you complete macros based on provided images of your meals.

- [ ] I would like to build an app that allows users to get recommended hang out locations based on their interst's and likes. Additionally, I want to see if it is possible to add current history of travel spots that can aso infuence their recommended hang out locations. This can possibly be uesed by pulling data from google maps or any location apps that users have used to get to different places in the past.

## Notes

Challenges involved in building the app simply included getting used to XCode's interface
